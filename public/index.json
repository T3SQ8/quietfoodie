Place the flour on your countertop and make a well in the middle. Place the water in the well and slowly bring the flour towards the middle with a fork. If the dough is too dry add more water. Work the dough until it all comes together. Place in the fridge for 20 minutes.\nFlour your work surface and roll out the dough so that you have a square. Place thin slices of one third of the butter (one of the three parts you cut before), leaving a two-fingers margin around the square. Bring the bottom side up and make sure the edges of the square are overlapping.\nBring the right side to the left, making sure the edges of the square overlap. Roll out the dough again, forming a square. Place the dough and the remaining butter in the fridge for 10 minutes. Repeat the process 2 more times and your puff pastry is ready to use. Leave the dough in the fridge until you\u0026rsquo;re ready to use it.\nFor the pastry cream\nBeat the eggs with the sugar in a pan until the mixture turns pale. Add the flour mixing well.\nAnd then add the boiling milk. Put the pan on your stove top at a medium-low temperature and continue mixing until it boils. In the end you should have a somewhat thick mixture. Remove from the stove and add the vanilla.\nAssembling the tarts\nPeel the apples and slice them thinly. Temporarily place them in a bowl with fresh water and some juice from a lemon.\nRoll out your puff pastry until it is 3-4mm (0.12-0.16in) thick. Cut it in rectangles with the width of your apples plus nearly 1cm (0.4in) on each side. Place the puff pastry rectangles in a floured baking tray and spread some pastry cream (2 tablespoons). Place the apple slices overlapping on top of the cream, leaving 1cm (0.4in) all around the rectangle.\nBake in a preheated oven to 200ºC (395ºF) for 20 minutes or until it turns golden.\nThe tarts will look a little bland and that\u0026rsquo;s when the apricot jam comes in to give a little shine. I used joyofbaking.com recipe, where you basically heat up some apricot jam with a tablespoon of water.\nBrush the tarts with the mixture and and they\u0026rsquo;re ready!\nLet them cool down before serving.\n"

Add 100g (1 cup) of flour (out of the total weight) and 1 tablespoon of sugar (also out of the total amount of sugar). Leave the dough to rise covered for 20 minutes in a warm place.\nIn a big bowl, mix the flour, the eggs, the sugar and the milk. Work the dough for a few minutes.\nAdd the melted butter, the salt, the cinnamon, the fennel and the yeast dough. Mix well until the dough no longer sticks to your hands nor to the bowl.\nLet it rise covered for 2-5hours depending on the place you leave it (my kitchen was warm and it took about 3h30). Once is has doubled in size, divide the dough in two parts. Leave a bit of dough from each part to later make the cross. Form round loaves and place them in a floured baking tray.\nFlatten their surface a little and place the boiled eggs on top (optional). Form four strips with the remaining dough and place them on top of the eggs. Brush the loaves with a egg wash and bake in a preheated oven to 210ºC (410ºF) (fan off) until the loaves are golden (about 20 minutes). Let it cool down before serving.\n"
